CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.

CSS Comments
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.

Comments are ignored by browsers.

A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:

EXAMPLE:
/* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red;
}

Comments can also span multiple lines:
EXAMPLE:
/* This is
a multi-line
comment */

p {
  color: red;
}

HTML and CSS Comments
From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the <!--...--> syntax.

EXAMPLE:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p {
  color: red; /* Set text color to red */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>My Heading</h2>

<!-- These paragraphs will be red -->
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
<p>CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>

</body>
</html>
