A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

The CSS element Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element nama.

EXAMPLE:
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

#
The CSS Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
EXAMPLE:
* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
